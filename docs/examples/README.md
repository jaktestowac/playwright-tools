# üìù Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use `playwright-tools` in real-world scenarios.

## üìÅ Available Examples

### [Network Monitoring Examples](./network-monitoring-examples.ts)

Comprehensive examples of network monitoring functionality:

- **Basic Network Monitoring** - Monitor all network activity during page navigation
- **API Performance Testing** - Analyze API call performance and identify slow requests
- **User Journey Network Analysis** - Track network activity during complete user workflows
- **Error Detection and Analysis** - Focus on network failures and error responses
- **Real-time Network Monitoring** - Monitor network activity in real-time during test execution
- **Performance Regression Testing** - Compare network performance against baseline metrics
- **Data Export and Reporting** - Export network data for external analysis

## üöÄ How to Use Examples

1. **Copy the example code** into your test files
2. **Adapt the selectors and URLs** to match your application
3. **Modify the configuration options** based on your needs
4. **Run the examples** with your Playwright test runner

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { basicNetworkMonitoring } from './docs/examples/network-monitoring-examples';

test('Monitor network during login', async ({ page }) => {
  const report = await basicNetworkMonitoring(page);
  
  // Assert on network metrics
  expect(report.summary.totalRequests).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(report.summary.failedRequests).toBe(0);
});
```
